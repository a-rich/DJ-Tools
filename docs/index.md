# Welcome to DJ Tools

DJ Tools started out as a set of scripts used to sync audio files to the cloud so I could share tracks with my friends. It's since grown into a Python library with many features for streamlining the processes around collecting, curating, and sharing a music collection.

Although some of DJ Tool's features cater to Rekordbox users (everything under the `Rekordbox` package) the majority of this library is DJ-platform agnostic. As an aside, I'm seeking development help from Denon, Serato, Traktor, etc. users who can implement serializers for the databases used by those platforms (see [this issue](https://github.com/a-rich/DJ-Tools/issues/68)).

DJ Tools is built and tested on Unix-based operating systems as well as Windows; that being said, 15% of this library's users are on Windows and so support for that OS may lag from time to time.

## Why does any of this matter?
It may not matter at all to you, but I've found each capability DJ Tools offers to be useful enough to provide as a first-class feature of the library. If you need convincing or are just curious, you can read some [exposition on the relevant topics](conceptual_guides/index.md).

## Where to start
Check out the [Getting Started](tutorials/getting_started/index.md) tutorial!

If you're a Rekordbox user, it's recommended that you also take a look at the [Get to Know Your Rekordbox Collection](tutorials/rekordbox_collection.md) tutorial.

## How do I...?
Every capability of DJ Tools is demonstrated in the [How-to Guides](how_to_guides/index.md). Additionally, there are some guides for things external to DJ Tools such as [setting up object storage](how_to_guides/setup_object_storage.md), getting [access to the Reddit and Spotify APIs](how_to_guides/reddit_spotify_api_access.md), and [standardizing your audio files](how_to_guides/standardizing_files.md) to ensure compatibility with DJ Tools.
