# DJ Tools
## Overview of Tools:
* `clone_library.py`: download / upload MP3s, download `rekordbox.xml`
* `spotify_analysis.py`: compare Spotify playlists with each other and local folders to identify overlapping or missing tracks 
* `download.sh`: download track(s) by URL via youtube-dl (Soundcloud)
* `rename.py`: rename ugly files downloaded with the `download.sh` script
* `randomize_tracks.py`: randomize track number (and other select ID3 tag fields) to 'shuffle' library
* `key_analysis.py`: analyze / visualize melodic key information in library
----------
## Cloning Library
### Description:
This script can download from / upload to an AWS S3 instance which stores all the MP3s of the track collection. In addition, it can download a `rekordbox.xml` file which can be used to selectively import Rekordbox data (BPM, beatgrid, hot cues, and My Tag information) for tracks and/or playlists.
### Roadmap:

- Update ID3 tag field for `Genre`
    * [x] `Bass > Favorites`
    * [ ] `House > Favorites`
    * [ ] `Bass > All` 
    * [ ] `House > All` 
    * [x] `Techno > All` 
    * [x] `New Tracks` after `2021-04-28`
    * [ ] `New Tracks` after `2020`
    * [ ] `Collection`
- Update hot cue schema
    * [x] `Bass > Favorites` 
    * [ ] `Bass > All`
    * [x] `House > All`
    * [x] `Techno > All`
### Prerequisites:
* `python >= 3.6`
    - Mac installation: `brew install python`
    - Linux installation: `sudo apt install python3.8`
    - Windows installation: [Windows releases](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/) or [3.9.4 installer](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.9.4/python-3.9.4-amd64.exe)
* `awscli`
    - Mac installation: `brew install awscli`
    - Linux installation: `sudo apt-get install awscli`
    - Windows installation [[official instructions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2-windows.html)]: [download installer](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/AWSCLIV2.msi) OR run `msiexec.exe /i https://awscli.amazonaws.com/AWSCLIV2.msi`
### Configuring `awscli`:
In your terminal run the following command to configure `awscli` for access to the AWS S3 instance:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; `aws configure --profile DJ`

Enter the provided `access_key` and `secret_key`. Default values for the rest of the configuration is fine.

```

### Usage Flow Chart:
![alt text](images/usage_flow_chart.png "Usage Flow Chart")

### Examples (Windows users should use a `--path` like `D:`):
ðŸŸ¢ Download mp3 files only:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; `python clone_library.py --path /path/to/USB --download music`

ðŸŸ¢ Only download contents of `Techno` folder:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; `python clone_library.py --path /path/to/USB --download music --include Techno`

ðŸŸ¢ Ignore contents of `Bass` and `Other` folders :

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; `python clone_library.py --path /path/to/USB --download music --exclude Bass Other`

ðŸ”µ Redownload mp3 files with updated ID3 tags:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; `python clone_library.py --path /path/to/USB --download music --use_date_modified`

ðŸ”´ Download mp3 files and my `rekordbox.xml` which tracks can be imported from to use my BMP, beatgrid, hot cues, and My Tags:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; `python clone_library.py --path /path/to/USB --download music xml`

âšª Upload all new music (not tested with Windows):

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; `python3 clone_library.py --path /path/to/USB --upload music`

-------------
### Importing Music From `rekordbox.xml`:
Ensure you have the proper `rekordbox.xml` file selected under Preferences > Advanced > Database > rekordbox xml:
![alt text](images/Pioneer_Preferences_Database.png "Select XML database")

Also make sure you have made the `rekordbox.xml` database visible under Preferences > View > Layout > rekordbox xml:
![alt text](images/Pioneer_Preferences_View.png "Show XML database in side panel")

Then select the track(s) or playlist(s) and select "Import To Collection"; this will overwrite BPM, beatgrid, hot cue, and My Tags information for files with the same name!

For convenience, there's a folder called `New Tracks` which can be referenced to find the most recent additions to the collection. Playlists in this folder are organized both anually and by the date of the upload session.

Alternatively, you may import tracks from different playlists (or just import the entire playlist) but there are no guarantees that those playlists are perfectly maintained. However, in the case of the `Genre` playlists, these can be objectively recreated by searching your collection for that genre...i.e. ensuring you're up-to-date with `New Tracks` means you can recreate a perfectly maintained set of subgenre folders as I am actively trying to do.

In the image below, note the playlist palette and two filtering options for ID3 tags and My Tags, respectively, circled in red; you can use these for quick playlist building.

Also reference the column layout; don't forget to include the `Date Added`, `Color`, and `Genre` columns in your own layout by right-clicking the column headers area. Sort by `Date Added` and import the most recent tracks you haven't imported yourself yet. Or sort by `Genre` and import just the styles of music you want.
![alt text](images/Pioneer_New-Tracks_Playlist_3.png "Import XML data into collection")

When I process a track, I set the `Color` to `green (Closing)` as a default. As I mix (or if it's immediately apparent while importing) I may set `Color` to `red (Headline)` or `blue (Opening)` if a track has too much or too little energy, respectively, to sustain a groove. Additionally I may set `Color` to `yellow (WARNING)` if the track was not able to be processed or is otherwise deemed unmixable or at least a risky mix. The usage of `red` and `blue` in this color scheme is largely neglected; basically you should use color as an indicator of whether or not a track has been processed.

**NOTE ABOUT BACKING UP YOUR DATA:**

There may be mp3 files available for tracks that I haven't processed yet; this means importing from the `rekordbox.xml` will effectively be the same as importing from the `Explorer`; in otherwords, the BPM and beatgrid will be whatever is default according to Rekordbox and the hot cues and My Tags will not exist yet. You may either import and process the tracks yourself or wait until I push a more up-to-date `rekordbox.xml`.

If you want to retain your custom BPM, beatgrid, hot cue, and My Tags data, you **must not** reimport that track, or any playlist containing that track, from my `rekordbox.xml` once you've made the changes on your local file system. I suggest keeping a regular backup of your rekordbox library data (`File > Export Collection in xml format`) in a file called `my_rekordbox.xml` so you can restore data for tracks and playlists in the event they are overwritten or lost.

If you want to retain your custom ID3 tag field modifications (artist(s), track name, genre(s), comments), you **must not** run `clone_library.py` with the `--use_date_modified` flag. Alternatively, you may run with the `--use_date_modified` flag and additionally use either the `--include` or the `--exclude` option to prevent redownloading contents of folders containing the tracks you want to preserve.
