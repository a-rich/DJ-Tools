"""This module contains classes for collections of different DJ software
platforms.

Collection is an abstract base class which defines the interface expected of a
collection; namely methods for (de)serialization to/from the representation
recognized by the DJ software for which Collection is being sub-classed.

RekordboxCollection is an implementation of Collection which operates on the
XML format that Rekordbox exports. The CustomSubstitution and
UnsortedAttributes classes are helpers for serializing a RekordboxCollection.
