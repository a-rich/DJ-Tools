"""This script is used to repair track file names that may be of an incorrect
format. The expected format for track file name is
'TRACK TITLE - ARTIST NAME.mp3'; this format is required in order for this
library to properly identify potential overlap between tracks in a Spotify
playlist(s) and tracks in the beatcloud. This format is also expected for
preprocessing tracks when populating the track title and artist ID3 tags. This
script is intended to be run as a three stage process...

(1) Running this script with just '--fuzz_ratio' will identify "bad" tracks
where the first part of the file name (split on ' - ') does not match
sufficiently with the track's ID3 tag value for track title. You should adjust
the fuzz ratio such that the output is easily readable and you can assert that
the identified tracks are indeed improperly formatted. If there are properly
formatted tracks that are incorrectly identified, you may add them to the
IGNORE_TRACKS set specified at the bottom of this script. If properly formatted
tracks are improperly identified because the ID3 tag for track title is wrong,
then those files should be retagged with Picard or MP3Tag or whatever tagging
software you use. They should then be reuploaded to the beatcloud with
'upload_music' and '--aws_use_date_modified'.

(2) Running this script with '--fuzz_ratio' and '--replace' will first rename
all the "bad" tracks (with the assumption that they are of the format
'ARTIST NAME - TRACK TITLE.mp3') and then remove the old improperly formatted
file from S3 (PLEASE ONLY DO THIS IF YOU ABSOLUTELY KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING!).
The script will NOT proceed to upload the new file; since 'aws s3 cp' uploads
one file at a time, I figured it would be better to use the natural parallelism
that 'aws s3 sync' offers and is implicit with using this library's
'upload_music' functionality).

(2.5) After renaming the files in step 2, you can open Rekordbox and click
'File > Display All Missing Files' which will trigger Rekordbox to identify all
the files you renamed. After doing this, click "Collection" and sort by the
left-most column to aggregate all the missing files (those with a '!' symbol in
the left-most column); you can now shift-click all the missing files and create
a new playlist out of them. Name this playlist "Missing Files" or something
unique. Once this playlist is created, click
'File > Export Collection in xml format'.

(3) Running the script with '--xml_path' and '--xml_swap_playlist' will parse
the XML file (the one you created in step 2.5), find the playlist you created
with all the missing files, and fix all the track locations using the same
operation used to rename the files in step 2.

(3.5) Now that you've modified the XML file so the missing files now have the
correct Location field, you can set your import XML to be this one and import
the tracks in this missing files playlist into your collection to relocate them
while retaining the original beatgrid, hot cues, etc.
