# Contribution
If you wish to contribute to `DJ Tools`, please follow these development rules:
1. Only release branches (`major: 3.0.0`, `minor: 2.3.0`, `patch: 2.2.2`) can be made off of `main`
2. The only commits to `main` that are allowed are updates to the `Release Plan` portion of this `README`
3. New features are added to the next minor release branch which will be created and released quarterly (the 1st of January, April, July, and October)
4. Bug fixes are added to the next patch release branch which will be created whenever the last is published to PyPI
5. Non-release branches must have a concise name for the feature or bugfix specifically targeted by that branch (e.g. `xml-track-randomization`)
6. If collaborating on a feature/fix with another user, prefix the feature/fix branch name with `username/`
