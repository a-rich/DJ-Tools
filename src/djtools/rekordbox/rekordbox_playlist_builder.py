    The "rekordbox_playlists.json" configuration file maps implemented
    TagParsers to a playlist taxonomy. Currently supported TagParsers are:
        * GenreTagParser: reads "Genre" field of tracks and creates a list of

    A "rekordbox_playlists.json" configuration file may also contain a
    "Combiner" key which is distinct from a TagParser implementation.
    Rather than parse tags, this class accepts the constructed tag -> track
    mapping and applies boolean algebra to create playlists using operators:
        * AND (designated with "&"): result set will contain tracks having both tags.
        * OR (designated with "|"): result set will contain tracks having either tag.
        * NOT (designated with "~"): result set will not contain tracks having this tag.
