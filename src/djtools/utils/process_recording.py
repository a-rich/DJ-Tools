"""This module is used to process an audio recording.

Given a recording of multiple tracks and a Spotify playlist, use the
information from the Spotify API to:

- split the recording into individual files
- name these files with the title and artist(s)
- populate the title, artist, and album tags
- normalize the audio so the headroom is AUDIO_HEADROOM decibels
- export the files with the configured AUDIO_BITRATE and AUDIO_FORMAT
