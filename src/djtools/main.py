"""This is the main function which runs the configured operations of `djtools`.

The logger is initialized from a configuration file. Then `config.yaml` is read
(if it exists) and the individual packages' configuration objects are
instantiated. The optional C extension to accelerate edit distance computation,
Levenshtein, is imported. The loop iterates all the supported top-level
operations of the library and calls the corresponding function with the
appropriate configuration object. Finally, the log file generated from this run
is uploaded to the Beatcloud.
